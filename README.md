# Pseudobook

Pseudobook is a Facebook-like social networking application that was hosted on the school's server. It was created with two other students as part of Object-Oriented Design and Analysis course. Text-file based persistence was one of the requirements given by the instructor. The application was written using Java/JavaServer Pages and was hosted on the school's server using Apache Tomcat.
